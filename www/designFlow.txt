Project Plans initial ideas...

Step 1: Define the Data Structure
Sketch a schema like:
Team = {
    "team_name": str,
    "head_coach": str,
    "coach_tenure": int,
    "offensive_style": str,
    "defensive_style": str,
    "team_rating": float,
    "recruiting_score": float,
    "returning_production_pct": float,
    "transfer_net_rating": float,
    "schedule_strength": float,
    "home_field_advantage": float,
    "previous_season_wins": int,
    "previous_season_losses": int,
}


Then map these features to their sources. For example:
- offensive_style → scraped from CollegeFootballNetwork
- recruiting_score → 247Sports composite ranking
- transfer_net_rating → derived from On3 transfer tracker

Step 2: Gather the Data
Write Python scripts to fetch or parse key features. Start with:
- Team Ratings + Schedules → EA Sports Rankings / CollegeFootballNews
- Coaches + Schemes → scraping CFN or GamesRadar
- Roster Strength → 247Sports + PFF + Transfer Portal stats

Step 3: Build Feature Matrix + Target
Once the data’s structured and cleaned:
- Encode categorical features (like scheme types)
- Normalize numerical features (recruiting scores, schedule difficulty)
- Define target label: win count or win-loss ratio

Starting with Arizona, Washington, Colorado, Alabama, and Kansas State rosters and go from there...
